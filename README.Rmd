### Running in docker

This package includes a Dockerfile built on top of the rocker/rstudio image.
We have also hosted the image on dockerhub, so you can easily get an Rstudio
server setup for development running on the cloud:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8787 -e USER=<username> -e PASSWORD=<password> ashander/phenoecosim
```

Navigating to the public DNS of the server will give you an Rstudio login screen.
